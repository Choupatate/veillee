"""Account credentials for people who can log into Storybook (FEATURES.md
F19), layered on top of people.py's Person model rather than a parallel
identity system: every account is bound to exactly one Person, and most
People have none (a child, a grandparent who's passed — anyone who's in the
book but never logs in). Pure functions taking the people directory as
their first argument, no hidden global state, same shape as people.py.

Credentials live in `people/<slug>/account.json`, a sibling of that
person's `index.md` rather than fields inside it — index.md is read by
every page render, kinship walk, and tree JSON; keeping the password hash
in a narrowly-read file shrinks the blast radius of any future bug that
logs or dumps a Person. Plain JSON, not YAML/frontmatter: this is small
structured data with no prose body, and stdlib `json` avoids leaning on
python-frontmatter's transitive PyYAML dependency for something new.
